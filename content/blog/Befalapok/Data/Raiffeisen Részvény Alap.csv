"Bef. politika rövid leírása:","A Raiffeisen Részvény Alap mûködése során a törvényi elõírások betartása mellett eszközei legalább 50%-át részvényekbe (azon belül túlnyomó részt hazai részvényekbe), a fennmaradó részt likvid és kockázatmentes eszközökbe (pl. állampapír, bankbetét) fekteti. Az Alapkezelõ a piaci helyzet mindenkori megítélésének megfelelõen dönt a részvényeknek és egyéb eszközöknek az alap saját tõkéjén belüli arányáról, így elõfordulhat olyan piaci szituáció, gazdasági esemény, amikor a részvényhányadot az Alapkezelõ 50% alá csökkenti, a befektetõk vagyonának megõrzése érdekében. Kedvezõ tõkepiaci helyzetben ugyanakkor a részvények aránya megközelítheti a 100%-ot is. A Befektetési jegyek zavartalan visszaváltásának biztosítása érdekében a Törvény értelmében likvid eszköznek minõsülõ eszközöknek az Alap saját tõkéjéhez viszonyított aránya rendszerint 5% és 15% között fog mozogni. Az Alapkezelõ a hazai vállalatok mélyreható és sokoldalú elemzése segítségével olyan befektetési stratégiát alakít ki, amely középtávon az egyedi részvényekbe történõ befektetés kockázati szintjénél alacsonyabb kockázat mellett a kötvénybefektetések hozamát meghaladó megtérülést biztosít."
