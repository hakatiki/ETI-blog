"Bef. politika rövid leírása:","Az Alap segítségével az Alapkezelõ a legfejlettebb tõkepiacokat hozza közelebb a Befektetõkhöz: az Apolló befektetési stratégiájának célja fõként az észak-amerikai és nyugat-európai részvénypiacok teljesítményébõl való részesedés. Ez jelentõs kockázatot, ugyanakkor kiemelkedõ hozampotenciált is rejt magában, ami miatt az Alapot elsõsorban a kockázatkedvelõ Befektetõk portfóliójába tudjuk ajánlani. Az Alap eszközei között szereplõ egyedi részvények a portfóliómenedzsereink által kialakított stratégia mentén kerülnek a portfólióba, ami egyaránt figyelembe veszi a historikus árfolyam adatokat, értékeltséget és a részvények között fennálló kapcsolatokat."
