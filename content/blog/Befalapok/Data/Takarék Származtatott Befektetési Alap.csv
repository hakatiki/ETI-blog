Az Alap törekszik a leglikvidebb származtatott termékek kereskedésére, amiben folyamatosan vagy legalább a teljes európai-amerikai idõzónában zajlik kereskedés. Az Alap nem származtatott eszközökön kívül elsõsorban olyan  hitelviszonyt megtestesítõ értékpapírokba fektet, amelyeket a Magyar Állam, az EGT vagy az OECD tagállam kormánya, belföldi és külföldi társaságok vagy egyéb jogalanyok bocsátottak ki, valamint befektethet betétekbe és betétjellegû eszközökbe és kollektív befektetési értékpapírokba is. A származtatott ügyletek alkalmazására fedezeti célból és a befektetési célok megvalósítása érdekében is lehetõség van."
