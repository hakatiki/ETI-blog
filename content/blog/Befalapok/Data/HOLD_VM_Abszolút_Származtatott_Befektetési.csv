"Bef. politika rövid leírása:","Az Alap potenciális befektetési területe a lehetõ legszélesebb és globális: bankbetétek, hazai és nemzetközi részvények illetve kötvények, devizák, egyéb befektetési eszközök, valamint ezekre és árupiaci termékekre vonatkozó származtatott ügyletek. A hagyományos befektetési alapoktól a széles eszköztáron túl abban tér el, hogy nem csak emelkedõ, de esõ piacon is van lehetõsége hozamot elérni. 

Az Alapkezelõ az Alap sikeres kezelése érdekében várhatóan befektetési tanácsokat vesz igénybe olyan társaságtól/társaságoktól, amelyek rendelkeznek befektetési tanácsadásra vonatkozó engedéllyel.

Az Alap célja az állampapírok által biztosított hozamnál nagyobb hozam elérése addicionális kockázat vállalása mellett. A többlethozam elérésének érdekében az Alap magasabb kockázatú instrumentumokat is vásárol és ad el, alapvetõen technikai alapú idõzítéssel, az eszközöket szelektíven kiválasztva. Ha viszont az Alapkezelõ nem lát megfelelõ lehetõséget magasabb kockázatú instrumentumokban, akkor alacsony kockázatú eszközökbe fekteti az Alap tõkéjét, egészen addig, amíg jó vételi vagy eladási lehetõségek nem adódnak."
